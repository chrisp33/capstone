Find Me Device: by Neeraj Desai, William Krozack, Edgar Nzokwe, and Christopher Pagan



Traveling from one destination to another can be challenging when our minds are constantly trying to multi-task. With the increase of activities, our mind is bombarded daily with problems, to-do lists, appointments, and other mind taxing tasks, thus we tend to leave them behind. With this in mind, the Find Me Device team created a luggage tag device that allows users to keep track of their luggage while traveling without the worry of losing it. Utilizing a GPS chip, the user is able to track where their luggage has been with convenience. The FONA chip connects to cellular towers to send the GPS data to a server. The Android application will retrieve the data when required. The device also has a Bluetooth chip that can be paired with an Android phone within 20 ft, thus if the user walks further than this distance from their luggage, their phone will receive an alert. Our solution therefore offers the benefits of ensuring that the user does not leave behind their belongings and helps the user find them if lost.


The FMD app works by first connecting the phone to the FMD via Bluetooth.
If the user is out of the range of the FMD, the app will send an alert and will have to reconnect to the FMD.

The user can also retrieve the last known location of the device by tapping the "Show Location" button, which will open a map application and show the FMD's current location.
The user can also tap the "Show Logs" button to get a list of previous latitudes and longitudes recorded by the FMD.
